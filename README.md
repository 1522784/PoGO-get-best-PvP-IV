# PoGO-get-best-PvP-IV
A small node-program that prints the best IV combination for the great league

# How to use:

  Requirements:
   You need to have node and npm locally installed.
  
- run: npm install mathjs
- Research the BaseStats of the species you want to get the perfect IVs from
- Insert those BaseStats into line 3 of getBest.js
- run: npm start
- wait 10 secounds

You get the best 100 IV combinations for this species with the maximal level, the stat product and a percentage comparison to the best possible stat product.

# How to optimize

Do literally anything. This program is lacking a good UI, it's slow and the stat product is in rare cases not the best value to compare pokemon performances, find a way to optimize. Also the few LoC are made quick and uncommented. Feel free to fork and change stuff.
